Iran's regime has killed over 12,000 civilians in just two weeks amid nationwide protests, creating a grave humanitarian crisis that demands urgent international action. Under the UN-endorsed Responsibility to Protect (R2P) doctrine, adopted unanimously in the 2005 World Summit Outcome Document (paragraphs 138-139), states have the primary duty to protect their populations from genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing, and crimes against humanity; when they manifestly fail—as Iran is now—the international community must take collective action through diplomatic, humanitarian, and other peaceful means, and in extreme cases, timely and decisive response including Chapter VII measures.


This rewrite integrates the civilian death toll, legitimate defense, and R2P as a moral and legal imperative. It positions your project as part of the global obligation to support civilian protection and democratic self-determination, while staying focused on digital, tech, and civic tools.

72‑Hour Emergency Call: Activate Iran's Digital Civic Defense Under R2P

The Iranian regime has massacred over 12,000 civilians in the past two weeks alone during nationwide protests—unprecedented bloodshed that constitutes crimes against humanity and triggers the international community's Responsibility to Protect (R2P)

UN World Summit Outcome Document (2005), paragraphs 138-139:  
"Each individual State has the responsibility to protect its populations from genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity. [...] The international community should, as appropriate, encourage and help States to exercise this responsibility and support the United Nations in establishing an early warning capability. [...] [The international community, through the United Nations,] undertakes to complement such national efforts with its responsibility to protect populations from genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity. [...] this responsibility entails using appropriate diplomatic, humanitarian and other peaceful means [...] and should we collectively be in agreement that countries are manifestly failing to protect their populations from genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity, we should take collective action, in a timely and decisive manner, through the Security Council, in accordance with the Charter, including Chapter VII, on a case-by-case basis."
  

Iranians are exercising their right to legitimate defense against a regime that has forfeited its sovereign duty to protect its people. Our global diaspora and allies now have a moral and legal imperative to build the infrastructure that empowers civilians, coordinates resistance, and hastens regime accountability.  

In the next 72 hours, till Fri. Jan 16, we aim to raise 9 million Euros in crypto to launch Iran's Digital Civic Defense Network—a decentralized, democratic platform uniting Iranians worldwide to protect lives, deliberate strategy, and build the future.  

Core pillars of activation:  
1. Tech customized for civilian defense  
- Adapt and deploy the world's best secure comms, drone tech for surveillance/safety (non-offensive), mesh networks, and ZK-voting tools to equip protestors and coordinators with life-saving capabilities.  
2. Digital War Room uniting all voices  
- 24/7 command hub drawing from AtlasIran-mapped groups (TransCF, diaspora networks, ethnic leaders, women/student activists, monarchists, democrats)—for real-time intel, strategy, and democratic decision-making.
3. Secure delivery routes  
 - Establish resilient supply chains for tech, info, and humanitarian aid into Iran, fulfilling R2P's call for timely support to at-risk populations.
4. Recruit, train, operate  
- Scale training in OPSEC, drone ops, digital warfare, and governance; refine procedures for a unified , representative force.  
5. Global Press Office  
- Amplify civilian voices, document atrocities, and rally international enforcement of R2P against the regime.  
6. Democratic DeFi Bank  
- Launch the on-chain treasury as Iran's civic war chest—governed by verifiable votes, funding protection efforts with full transparency.
